Good morning All!

Attached please find the documentation on migration of Snow Crab Trawl
Survey data. Please review the document and let me know if you would like to
add any more info. I didn't describe much on the views, as they will be
modified based on your requirement. At that time, I will update the
document.

In addition, I am attaching the Data Dictionary and User Guide for Observer
system to help you understand Observer system.

Thanks,
Kohila
